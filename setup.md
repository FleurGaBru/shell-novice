You need to copy the data-files directory to your home:

1. Login on the server.
2. Type `cp -r /scratch/tmp/data-shell .`, then press the Enter key. Don't forget to type the **.** !
3. Type `cd`, then press the Enter key. That last step will make sure you start with your home folder as your working directory.

In the lesson, you will find out how to access the data in this folder.
